# Kiro Spec Mode: Your Blueprint for Better Software

> **Transform vague ideas into production-ready code** with structured specifications that bridge the gap between product requirements and technical implementation.

## Why Kiro Specs?

Building software without a clear plan leads to endless revisions, scope creep, and frustrated teams. Kiro Specs solve this by creating a structured workflow that ensures alignment from concept to deployment.

**The Problem:**
- 🔄 Endless back-and-forth between product and engineering
- 📝 Vague requirements that lead to wrong implementations  
- 🐛 Missing edge cases discovered too late
- ⏰ Development iterations that could have been avoided

**The Solution:**
- ✅ **Structured requirements** in testable EARS notation
- 🏗️ **Technical design** with architecture diagrams
- 📋 **Implementation roadmap** with trackable tasks
- 🎯 **Clear acceptance criteria** everyone understands

## How Kiro Specs Work

Specs bridge the gap between conceptual product requirements and technical implementation details, ensuring alignment and reducing development iterations. Kiro generates three key files that form the foundation of each specification:

### 📋 requirements.md
**What it does:** Captures user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation

The requirements.md file is written in the form of user stories with acceptance criteria in EARS notation - the way you wish your PM would give you requirements!

**EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format:**
```
WHEN [condition/event] THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected behavior]
```

**Example:**
```
WHEN a user submits a form with invalid data 
THE SYSTEM SHALL display validation errors next to the relevant fields

WHEN a user successfully logs in 
THE SYSTEM SHALL redirect them to their dashboard within 2 seconds
```

**Why EARS notation works:**
- **Clarity:** Requirements are unambiguous and easy to understand
- **Testability:** Each requirement can be directly translated into test cases
- **Traceability:** Individual requirements can be tracked through implementation
- **Completeness:** The format encourages thinking through all conditions and behaviors

### 🏗️ design.md  
**What it does:** Documents technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations

This is where you capture the big picture of how the system will work, including components and their interactions. Kiro's specs offer a structured approach to design documentation, making it easier to understand and collaborate on complex systems.

**Typical sections include:**
- Architecture overview
- Data flow diagrams
- Interface specifications
- Data models
- Error handling strategies
- Unit testing strategy

**Benefits:**
- Technical alignment across teams
- Implementation guidance
- Living architecture documentation
- Collaboration on complex systems

### ✅ tasks.md
**What it does:** Provides detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks and sub-tasks

Each task is clearly defined with a clear description, expected outcome, and any necessary resources or dependencies. Kiro provides a task execution interface for tasks.md files that displays real-time status updates.

**Key features:**
- Tasks updated as in-progress or completed
- Real-time status tracking
- Efficient progress monitoring
- Up-to-date development status view

**Benefits:**
- Structured implementation approach
- Progress visibility for stakeholders
- Task dependency management
- Team coordination and accountability

## The Spec Workflow

The workflow follows a logical progression with decision points between phases, ensuring each step is properly completed before moving to the next:

```
💡 Start a spec → 📋 requirements.md → 🏗️ design.md → ✅ Implementation → 🚀 Execution
                      ↓ Happy?           ↓ Happy?
                   Edit/Request      Edit/Request
                     changes          changes
```

### Requirements Phase
**Focus:** Define user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation

- Transform vague feature requests into well-structured requirements
- Use EARS format for clarity and testability
- Ensure requirements are unambiguous and complete
- **Decision point:** Are requirements clear and complete?
- **If not:** Edit and refine until stakeholders agree

### Design Phase  
**Focus:** Document technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations

- Capture the big picture of system architecture
- Document component interactions and data flow
- Plan interfaces, data models, and error handling
- Create sequence diagrams for complex workflows
- **Decision point:** Is the technical approach sound and feasible?
- **If not:** Revise design and request changes

### Implementation Planning
**Focus:** Break down work into discrete, trackable tasks with clear descriptions and outcomes

- Convert design into actionable development tasks
- Define clear "done" criteria for each task
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Organize tasks for efficient execution
- **Outcome:** Ready-to-execute implementation plan

### Execution Phase
**Focus:** Track progress as tasks are completed, with ability to update and refine the spec as needed

- Real-time task status updates (in-progress, completed)
- Monitor development progress
- Adapt spec as requirements evolve
- Maintain alignment with original goals
- **Result:** Delivered feature that matches specifications

## Getting Started with Specs

### 1. Create a New Spec
```
💡 Idea for feature 'user-authentication'
    ↓
📝 Open spec session in chat
    ↓  
➕ Click '+' in spec pane
    ↓
📁 .kiro/specs/user-authentication/
   ├── requirements.md
   ├── design.md  
   └── tasks.md
```

Kiro automatically generates the three foundational files when you create a new spec, giving you a structured starting point for any feature development.

### 2. Follow the Structured Workflow
**Start with Requirements (requirements.md)**
- Define what you're building in clear user stories
- Use EARS notation for testable acceptance criteria
- Get stakeholder alignment before moving forward
- Transform vague ideas into structured specifications

**Move to Design (design.md)**
- Document technical architecture and approach
- Create sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Plan data models, interfaces, and error handling
- Ensure technical feasibility and team alignment

**Plan Implementation (tasks.md)**
- Break design into discrete, actionable tasks
- Define clear outcomes and success criteria
- Identify dependencies and execution order
- Create trackable milestones for progress monitoring

**Execute with Confidence**
- Use Kiro's task execution interface for real-time tracking
- Update task status as work progresses
- Maintain spec as living documentation
- Deliver features that match original specifications

### 3. Leverage Team Collaboration
**Product Teams:** Review requirements in familiar user story format with clear acceptance criteria
**Engineering Teams:** Get detailed technical specifications and architecture guidance  
**Project Managers:** Track progress with granular task visibility and real-time updates
**QA Teams:** Use structured requirements for comprehensive test planning

## Advanced Features

### File References in Specs
Spec files support including references to additional files using the syntax `#[[file:<relative_file_name>]]`. This powerful feature allows you to:

- **Reference API specifications:** Include OpenAPI specs to influence implementation
- **Link GraphQL schemas:** Reference GraphQL definitions for consistent development  
- **Include configuration files:** Reference config files for deployment specifications
- **Connect documentation:** Link to existing technical documentation

**Example usage:**
```markdown
The API should follow the specification defined in #[[file:api/openapi.yaml]]

Database schema is documented in #[[file:docs/database-schema.md]]
```

This creates low-friction integration between your specs and existing project documentation.
