# Kiro Hands-on Practice

Welcome to the Kiro hands-on experience! In this lab, you will learn how to use Kiro's AI capabilities to build applications quickly and efficiently.

## Practice 2: Build a Web Shooting Game and Deploy to AWS

In this practice, you will use Kiro to create a fully functional web shooting game with advanced features including enemy health bars, power-up systems, Boss stages, and deploy it to AWS serverless architecture.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use Kiro to build complex interactive web games
- Implement AWS serverless architecture deployment
- Master AWS resource management and cleanup

## 📋 Prerequisites

- AWS account with full permissions
- Configured AWS CLI

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Installed and running Kiro IDE
- AWS account with S3 and CloudFront access permissions
- Configured AWS CLI (for deployment)

### Step 1: Create Project Folder

- On your computer, create a folder named `MyShootingGame`
- This will become the project workspace for your shooting game application

### Step 2: Open Project in Kiro

- Launch Kiro IDE
- Click the "Open a project" button
- Select the `MyShootingGame` folder you just created
- Kiro will initialize the project workspace

### Step 3: Access Let's Build Feature

- In Kiro, navigate to the "Let's build" page
- You will see two available options:
  - **Vibe** - Chat first, build later. Explore ideas and iterate as you discover requirements
  - **Spec** - Plan first, build later. Create requirements and design before starting to code
- For this practice, choose "Vibe" mode
- Set the model to "Claude Sonnet 4" (or latest available version)
- Ensure Autopilot is enabled

### Step 4: Create Basic Shooting Game

In Kiro's chat area, enter the following prompt:

```
Please help me to build a web-base shooting game.
```

**Prompt Description:**
- Create a web-based shooting game
- Include basic shooting mechanics and enemy systems

### Step 5: Improve Game Controls

After the basic game is created, use the following prompt to improve the control experience:

```
Use keyboard to control spaceship is hard to target the enemies. Please help me to add the cursor mode. Also, please follow below rules:
- With cursor mode, please do not add Y axis direction movement, and the bullet on can shoot straight forward.
- Do not add auto-aim function.
- With cursor mode, please add a aim dot to represent cursor position.
```

**Improvement highlights:**
- Optimize aiming mechanics
- Dual control support:
  - **Keyboard control**: WASD movement, spacebar to shoot
  - **Mouse/Touch control**: Move cursor/finger to move, click/touch to shoot
- Add auxiliary aiming functionality

### Step 6: Add Enemy Health Bars and Game Instructions

Continue using the following prompt to enhance game functionality:

```
Please help me add a health bar on enemies to understand how many time left to take down it. Meanwhile, please add the how-to-play on the page
```

**New features:**
- Enemy health bar display
- Game instruction page
- Visual health indicators

### Step 7: Add Start Screen

Continue using the following prompt to enhance game functionality:

```
Create a start game page.
```

**New features:**
- Game start screen
- Initial control method selection

### Step 8: Implement Power-up System

Use the following prompt to add power-up mechanics:

```
I would like to add some random dropped items to temporarily power up myself. Such as shooting more fast, or shooting more wide.
```

**Power-up system includes:**
- Randomly dropped enhancement items
- **Triple Shot**: Triple shooting ability
- **Rapid Fire**: Fast shooting mode
- **Shield**: Protective shield
- Temporary enhancement effects

### Step 9: Add Boss Stage System

Use the following prompt to implement advanced stage mechanics:

```
When the score reach specific points, I would like to have a boss stage. Once the boss is eliminated, return to normal stage to get more points and wait next boss stage.
```

**Boss system features:**
- Boss stage appears every 200 points
- Gradually increasing game difficulty
- Special Boss battle mechanics

### Step 10: Deploy to AWS Serverless Architecture

Use the following prompt for AWS deployment:

```
Please help me deploy to my AWS Account with serverless architecture, make sure the S3 bucket not public read and can only go through Cloudfront. Please deploy
```

**Deployment requirements:**
- Use AWS serverless architecture
- All AWS CLI commands must include `--no-paginate` and `--no-cli-pager` parameters
- Automated deployment process

### Step 11: Resource Cleanup

After completing testing, use the following prompt to clean up AWS resources:

```
Please help me to terminate the related resources from my AWS account.
```

## 📁 Expected Project Structure

After completion, your project may include:

```

## 🎮 Expected Game Features

After completion, your shooting game should look like this:
- Game main screen
- Game instruction page

## 🏗️ AWS Architecture

**Serverless components:**
- **S3**: Static website hosting
- **CloudFront**: Global content distribution
- **Lambda**: Backend logic processing (if needed)
- **API Gateway**: API management (if needed)
- **DynamoDB**: Score recording (if needed)

## 🔧 Deployment Verification

After deployment is complete, verify the following items:
- Game can be accessed normally through CloudFront URL
- All game functions work properly
- AWS resources are created correctly
- Cost control within reasonable range

## 💡 Development Tips

**When interacting with Kiro:**
- Build features step by step, don't request too much at once
- Test each feature before continuing to the next step
- Specifically describe the game experience you want
- Utilize Kiro's iterative capabilities to optimize the game

**Game development best practices:**
- Maintain smooth game loop flow
- Appropriate visual feedback
- Balanced game difficulty curve
- Responsive design supporting multiple devices

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Game development issues:**
- **If game stutters**: Check game loop and rendering efficiency
- **If controls are unresponsive**: Adjust input handling and collision detection
- **If power-ups don't work**: Check state management and timers

**AWS deployment issues:**
- **If deployment fails**: Check AWS permissions and quotas
- **If game won't load**: Check S3 and CloudFront configuration
- **If CLI commands fail**: Ensure `--no-paginate` and `--no-cli-pager` are added

**Resource cleanup issues:**
- **If cleanup is incomplete**: Manually check AWS console
- **If there are residual charges**: Check all related services
- **Use Kiro for assistance**: "Please help me check if there are any missed AWS resources"

## ✅ Success Criteria

The practice is complete when you have accomplished the following:
- Basic shooting game works properly (similar game screen as shown in screenshots)
- Improved control system provides good experience (supports keyboard and mouse controls)
- Enemy health bars and game instructions implemented (includes complete How to Play page)
- Boss stage system works properly (score milestones trigger)
- Successfully deployed to AWS serverless architecture
