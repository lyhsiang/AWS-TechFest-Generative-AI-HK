# ðŸš€ Kiro Spec Workshop: Hands-On Exercises

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to use Kiro in a spec-driven development style. Unlike vibe coding where you give high-level instructions and let Kiro figure everything out, spec coding involves creating detailed specifications that break down complex features into manageable, well-defined tasks. This approach provides better control, documentation, and iterative development for complex projects.

Kiro's Spec feature allows you to formalize the design and implementation process by iterating on requirements, design, and implementation tasks with structured documentation before letting the agent work through the implementation.

This is a fully hands-on workshop. Through a series of exercises, you will design, develop, and deploy the same webshooting game as the vibe coding workshop, but using a more structured, specification-driven approach. By the end, you'll have a fully functional chatbot with text, image, and voice capabilities, secured with user authentication.

### Setup
Create a folder named `MyShootingGame` and open it in Kiro. Instead of starting with vibe coding, we'll create a comprehensive specification first.

In the Let's build page, select **Spec** instead of Vibe. This will open the spec creation interface.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- AWS account with full permissions
- Configured AWS CLI

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Guide

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- AWS account with S3 and CloudFront access permissions
- Configured AWS CLI (for deployment)

### Step 1: Create Project Folder

- On your computer, create a folder named `MyShootingGame`
- This will become the project workspace for your shooting game application

### Step 2: Open Project in Kiro

- Launch Kiro IDE
- Click the "Open a project" button
- Select the `MyShootingGame` folder you just created
- Kiro will initialize the project workspace

### Step 3: Access Let's Build Feature

- In Kiro, navigate to the "Let's build" page
- You will see two available options:
  - **Vibe** - Chat first, build later. Explore ideas and iterate as you discover requirements
  - **Spec** - Plan first, build later. Create requirements and design before starting to code
- For this practice, choose "Vibe" mode
- Set the model to "Claude Sonnet 4" (or latest available version)
- Ensure Autopilot is enabled

### Step 4: Create Basic Shooting Game

In Kiro's chat area, enter the following prompt:

```
Please help me to build a web-base shooting game and deploy to local.
```

##  ðŸš€ Exercise 1 - Generate Steering document in Kiro 

Steering gives Kiro persistent knowledge about your project through markdown files in .kiro/steering/. Instead of explaining your conventions in every chat, steering files ensure Kiro consistently follows your established patterns, libraries, and standards.

#### 1.1 Click Generate Steering Docs

<img width="966" height="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4647ee-9a60-4f14-b1f7-f1e837ad0e1a" />

#### 1.2 Review the outputs markdown file from Agent Steering to make update if need

- Product Overview (product.md): Defines your product's purpose, target users, and business objectives

- Technology Stack (tech.md): Documents frameworks, libraries, and technical constraints

- Project Structure (structure.md): Outlines file organization, naming conventions, and architectural decisions

##  ðŸš€ Exercise 2 - Use Specs feature for more comprehensive implementation 

#### 2.1 Go to Specs and click "+" asking Kiro to help you create a detailed requirements specification 

<img width="317" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13e57958-a17e-47b3-a60e-2a85bed8c1d7" />


```

Create a more comprehensive modern web-based shooting application with following high-level requirements: 
1) A clear page about how to play in the beginning  
2) Include a clear healthy bar or status of enemies for user to understand how many time left to take it down, 
3) allow user to select different themes and character, let's make 3 different themes and 3 different spaceship please refer to  a) Masked Rider themes b) ultraman c) Godzilla. 
4) implement a power-up system , add some random items temporarily power up myself. Such as shooting more fast, or shooting more wide, please create 10 different items, the more special the better
```

#### 2.1 Review the Requirements ( requirements.md ) provide by Kiro

Phase 1: Basic infrastructure setup
Phase 2: Frontend development and deployment
Phase 3: Backend API development
Phase 4: Bedrock integration
Phase 5: Security implementation
Phase 6: Testing and optimization

For each phase, provide specific tasks, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.
```

**Expected Outcome**
Kiro will generate a detailed implementation plan with:
- Phased approach to development
- Specific tasks for each phase
- Clear deliverables and milestones
- Acceptance criteria for quality assurance

### Review and Refinement
Review the generated spec document and refine it based on your specific needs. The spec should be comprehensive enough that any developer could understand what needs to be built.

The implementation will also include monitoring and alerting for security-related events.After completing this exercise, your chatbot application will have enterprise-grade security features that protect both the infrastructure and the users. The security implementation will follow industry best practices and address the requirements specified in your security specification document.

## ðŸš€ Exercise 9 -  Cleanup and Resource Management

```
Create and execute cleanup procedures:

- Document all deployed AWS resources
- Create cleanup scripts for complete resource removal
- Verify all resources are properly deleted
- Document any persistent data that needs backup
- Create re-deployment procedures for future use
```

**Expected Outcome**
Kiro will generate a comprehensive inventory of all AWS resources deployed for your chatbot application, including S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, API Gateway endpoints, Lambda functions, IAM roles, and any other resources. It will then create cleanup scripts (using AWS CDK, CloudFormation, or AWS CLI) to systematically remove these resources in the correct order to avoid dependency issues. The implementation will include verification steps to ensure all resources are properly deleted and documentation for any data that should be backed up before cleanup. Finally, Kiro will provide instructions for re-deploying the application in the future if needed.

After completing this exercise, you'll have successfully cleaned up all AWS resources used by your chatbot application, preventing any unexpected charges. You'll also have documentation and scripts that make it easy to redeploy the application in the future if desired.


## Comparing Spec vs Vibe Coding

After completing all exercises in this workshop, take some time to reflect on the differences between spec and vibe coding approaches:

### Advantages of Spec Coding:

* Better documentation and maintainability
* More predictable development process
* Easier to review and validate requirements
* Better suited for complex, enterprise applications
* Facilitates team collaboration and knowledge sharing

### When to Use Each Approach:

* Use Spec Coding for: Complex applications, team projects, enterprise software, long-term maintenance
* Use Vibe Coding for: Prototypes, simple applications, exploratory development, quick iterations

### Final Remarks
Spec coding with Kiro provides a more structured approach to AI-assisted development. While it requires more upfront planning, it results in better-documented, more maintainable, and more predictable software development processes.

The specifications you create become living documents that can be updated and refined as requirements change, making your development process more agile and responsive to changing needs. Consider using spec coding for your next complex project where documentation, maintainability, and team collaboration are important factors.
