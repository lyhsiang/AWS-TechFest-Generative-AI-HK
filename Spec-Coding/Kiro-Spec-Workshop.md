# Kiro Spec Workshop: Hands-On Exercises

> **Master specification-driven development** through practical exercises that demonstrate real-world scenarios and build your expertise with Kiro Specs.

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to use Kiro in a spec-driven development style. Unlike vibe coding where you give high-level instructions and let Kiro figure everything out, spec coding involves creating detailed specifications that break down complex features into manageable, well-defined tasks. This approach provides better control, documentation, and iterative development for complex projects.

Kiro's Spec feature allows you to formalize the design and implementation process by iterating on requirements, design, and implementation tasks with structured documentation before letting the agent work through the implementation.

This is a fully hands-on workshop. Through a series of exercises, you will design, develop, and deploy the same chatbot service as the vibe coding workshop, but using a more structured, specification-driven approach. By the end, you'll have a fully functional chatbot with text, image, and voice capabilities, secured with user authentication.


## Exercise 1 - Creating Your First Spec

**Scenario:** Build a comprehensive specification for a serverless chatbot application before writing any code.

### Setup
Create a folder named `MyCoolChatbotSpec` and open it in Kiro. Instead of starting with vibe coding, we'll create a comprehensive specification first.

In the Let's build page, select **Spec** instead of Vibe. This will open the spec creation interface.

### 1.1 Requirements Specification

Start by asking Kiro to help you create a detailed requirements specification:

```
Create a comprehensive requirements specification for a serverless chatbot application with the following high-level requirements:

- Frontend: CloudFront distribution serving a static website
- Backend: API Gateway + Lambda functions  
- AI: Integration with Amazon Bedrock for chat responses
- Security: Enterprise-grade security considerations
- Scalability: Serverless architecture for automatic scaling

Please break this down into detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
```

**Expected Outcome**
Kiro will generate a detailed requirements document that includes:

**Functional Requirements:**

### 1.3 Implementation Plan

Finally, create a detailed implementation plan:

```
Create a step-by-step implementation plan that breaks down the development into phases:

Phase 1: Basic infrastructure setup
Phase 2: Frontend development and deployment
Phase 3: Backend API development
Phase 4: Bedrock integration
Phase 5: Security implementation
Phase 6: Testing and optimization

For each phase, provide specific tasks, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.
```

**Expected Outcome**
Kiro will generate a detailed implementation plan with:
- Phased approach to development
- Specific tasks for each phase
- Clear deliverables and milestones

## Comparing Spec vs Vibe Coding

After completing all exercises in this workshop, take some time to reflect on the differences between spec and vibe coding approaches:

### Advantages of Spec Coding:

* Better documentation and maintainability
* More predictable development process
* Easier to review and validate requirements
* Better suited for complex, enterprise applications
* Facilitates team collaboration and knowledge sharing

### When to Use Each Approach:

* Use Spec Coding for: Complex applications, team projects, enterprise software, long-term maintenance
* Use Vibe Coding for: Prototypes, simple applications, exploratory development, quick iterations

### Final Remarks
Spec coding with Kiro provides a more structured approach to AI-assisted development. While it requires more upfront planning, it results in better-documented, more maintainable, and more predictable software development processes.

The specifications you create become living documents that can be updated and refined as requirements change, making your development process more agile and responsive to changing needs. Consider using spec coding for your next complex project where documentation, maintainability, and team collaboration are important factors.
